# freq

A tool for counting frequency of items and showing related statistics.

## Description

Over the years, Iâ€™ve found myself doing a lot of ad-hoc data analysis with
shell pipelines involving `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `sort`, `uniq -c`, and `sort -rn`
to look at distributions of values in datasets. I wrote `freq` to streamline
these tasks, and I use it daily.

It has feature flags to enable transparent decompression of several file
types, and also regular expression filtering/munging support.

## Usage

```
Usage: freq [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

Arguments:
  [FILES]...

Options:
  -g, --regex <REGEX>   Match regular expression - behavior depends on capture groups.

                        * With no capture group, matching lines will be counted.
                        * With one capture group, the captured portion of matching
                          lines will be counted.
                        * With two named capture groups (`n` and `item`), `n`
                          will be parsed as the number of occurrences of `item`.

  -d, --digits <N>      Digits of precision [default: 3]
  -l, --limit <N>       Limit output to top N values
  -m, --min <N>         Limit output to values seen at least N times
  -x, --max <N>         Limit output to values seen at most N times
  -I, --insertion       Sort values with same frequency by original order [default]
  -L, --lexigraphic     Sort values with same frequency lexicographically
  -U, --unstable        Do not sort values with same frequency
  -F, --no-freq-sort    Do not sort by frequency
  -r, --reverse         Output least common values first
  -u, --unique          Output unique values with no additional data
  -n, --number          Include line numbers
  -s, --sum             Include running sum totals
  -P, --no-pct          Omit percent column
  -C, --no-cdf          Omit CDF column
  -t, --tsv             Tab delimited output
  -c, --csv             Comma seperated output
  -h, --help            Print help
  -V, --version         Print version
      --semver <RANGE>  Check version and exit
```
